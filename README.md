## Analysis and prediction of labour turnover

- **1. Objective:** To analyse employee data in order to identify patterns that affect employee turnover, predict which employee profiles are most likely to leave and provide strategies to improve talent retention.
- **2. Project description:**
  - **Data collection:** The dataset used comes from Kaggle and is created by IBM data scientists (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
  - **Data preparation:** Columns that will not add value to the analysis are removed, columns are renamed, and duplicate values are eliminated.
  - **Creation of graphs and data extraction:** we formulate the different graphs and correlation maps that will allow us to analyse the relationships between the different variables.
- **3. Conclusions of the analysis carried out:**
  - **Definition of the factors that are associated with employee turnover.**
  - **Identification of patterns.**
  - **Recommendations for improving talent retention.**
